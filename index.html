            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Pokémon are fictional creatures that inhabit a rich and diverse world,
                each with its own unique traits, abilities, and personalities. They
                range from tiny, adorable beings like Pikachu to towering legends like
                Rayquaza, and they come in all shapes and types—such as Fire, Water,
                Psychic, or Dragon. Every Pokémon has a specific nature, base stats,
                and a set of moves it can learn, making each one distinct.
                <br /><br />
                These creatures can evolve into more powerful forms, often changing
                appearance and gaining new abilities. Evolution is a key part of a
                Pokémon's growth, representing its development through experience and
                bonding with its trainer. Some evolve by leveling up, while others
                need special conditions, like holding an item or being exposed to a
                certain environment.
                <br /><br />
                Beyond battling, many Pokémon are known for their behaviors, habitats,
                and relationships with humans and nature. Some live in forests,
                mountains, or oceans, while others adapt to cities and human-made
                environments. Their roles vary from partners and pets to protectors
                and even mythical beings tied to the balance of the world.
